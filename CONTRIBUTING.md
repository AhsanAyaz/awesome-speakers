Hello there !
Thank you for wanting to add some more awesome speakers here !

There are no strict guidelines when contributing to this repo but we have two requests that we think everyone should follow when a new person is added:

* You know the person / have seen a talk by them and think they're awesome.
* Also let the person know you are adding them here , they may not want for some reason and it's important to respect their privacy

As for the format please place:

* A picture , direct link to Github/Twitter
* Their name
* The topics they are interested in
* Twitter Link

Also please leave always two spaces after each line for formatting reasons.

Thank you for reading

Karl Horky
